## 1. INTRODUCTION

 `libweicws` is a micro blog oriented Chinese word segmentation system. It's
 the system we submit to Task 1: 
 [Micro-blog word segmentation](http://www.cipsc.org.cn/clp2012/task1.html)
 on 2012 CLP back-offs. The algorithm is presented in 
 [this paper](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/~yjliu/publication/clp2012.pdf)
 in detail.
 
 We want to devolop a library that can achieve some certain accuracy on micro
 blog corpus. We also want to make it compatiable crossing differen platform. 
 What's more, we are planning to provide different programming language
 interfaces including Java and Python.
 
## 2. PREREQUISITES

 This project requires:
  * Cross-platform Make (CMake) v2.8.0+
  * GNU Make or equivalent, MSVC can also work fine with it.
  * GCC or an alternative, reasonably conformant C++ compiler.
  * [PCRE-8.32](http://www.pcre.org/)
  * [crfsuite-0.12](http://www.chokkan.org/software/crfsuite/)


 NOTE: YOU DON'T NEED TO LINK PCRE AND CRFSUITE TO THIS PROJECT, WE HAVE
 INTEGRATED ABOVE TWO LIBRARIES INTO IT AND HACKED THE SOURCE A TINY LITTLE BIT.

## 3. BUILDING
 
 This project uses the Cross-platform Make (CMake) build system. However, we
 have conveniently provided a wrapper configure script and Makefile so that
 the typical build invocation of "./configure" followed by "make" will work.
 For a list of all possible build targets, use the command "make help".

 __In Unix (GCC)__:
 ```
 ./configue
 make
 ```

 __In Windows (MSVC)__:
 ```
 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake ..
 ```
 Open the Visual Studio solution `libweicws.sln`, and build it like other VS project.

 NOTE: Users of CMake may believe that the top-level Makefile has been
 generated by CMake; it hasn't, so please do not delete that file.

## 4. Example

 You can refer the `demo.cpp`. It's an example of loading model and conduct
 segmentation

## 5. LICENSE

 If you are rich of time, take a glance of COPYING file. If you are busy rushing
 your code, do whatever you want.
 
## 6. ChangeLog

 Still empty.

## TODO

 * Improve the performance
 * Multi-thread support
 * (?)Iteratior model over the result
