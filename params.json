Introduction\r\n 2. Prerequisites\r\n 3. Building\r\n 4. Example\r\n 5. License\r\n 6. ChangLog\r\n\r\n## 1. INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n `libweicws` is a micro blog oriented Chinese word segmentation system. It's\r\n the system we submit to Task 1: \r\n [Micro-blog word segmentation](http://www.cipsc.org.cn/clp2012/task1.html)\r\n on 2012 CLP back-offs. The algorithm is presented in \r\n [this paper](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/~yjliu/publication/clp2012.pdf)\r\n in detail.\r\n \r\n We want to devolop a library that can achieve some certain accuracy on micro\r\n blog corpus. We also want to make it compatiable crossing differen platform. \r\n What's more, we are planning to provide different programming language\r\n interfaces including Java and Python.\r\n \r\n## 2. PREREQUISITES\r\n\r\n This project requires:\r\n  * Cross-platform Make (CMake) v2.8.0+\r\n  * GNU Make or equivalent, MSVC can also work fine with it.\r\n  * GCC or an alternative, reasonably conformant C++ compiler.\r\n  * [PCRE-8.32](http://www.pcre.org/)\r\n  * [crfsuite-0.12](http://www.chokkan.org/software/crfsuite/)\r\n\r\nNOTE: You don't need to link libpcre and libcrfsuit to this project, we have\r\nintegrated above two libraries into it and hacked the source of their makefile\r\na tiny little bit.\r\n\r\n## 3. BUILDING\r\n \r\n This project uses the Cross-platform Make (CMake) build system. However, we\r\n have conveniently provided a wrapper configure script and Makefile so that\r\n the typical build invocation of \"./configure\" followed by \"make\" will work.\r\n For a list of all possible build targets, use the command \"make help\".\r\n\r\n __In Unix (GCC)__:\r\n ```\r\n ./configue\r\n make\r\n ```\r\n\r\n __In Windows (MSVC)__:\r\n ```\r\n mkdir build\r\n cd build\r\n cmake ..\r\n ```\r\n Open the Visual Studio solution `libweicws.sln`, and build it like other VS project.\r\n\r\n NOTE: Users of CMake may believe that the top-level Makefile has been\r\n generated by CMake; it hasn't, so please do not delete that file.\r\n\r\n## 4. Example\r\n\r\n You can refer the [demo.cpp](https://github.com/Oneplus/libweicws/blob/master/test/demo.cpp).\r\n It's an example of loading model and conducting segmentation over Chinese sentence.\r\n\r\n## 5. LICENSE\r\n\r\n If you are rich of time, take a glance of COPYING file. If you are busy rushing\r\n your code, do whatever you want.\r\n \r\n## 6. ChangeLog\r\n\r\n 2013-01-07 public inside HIT-SCIR Lab;\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n * Improve the performance\r\n * Multi-thread support\r\n * (?)Iteratior model over the result\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
